Plotting of 2 datasets has been done:
1) Yearwise Expiry of Mining Leases (https://data.gov.in/catalog/yearwise-expiry-mining-leases)
2) Trend in population of Towns : Haryana (https://data.gov.in/catalog/area-and-population-haryana-statistical-abstract)

3 types of plots were generated:

1) Scatter plot(Generated for the 1st dataset) - It shows how the number of leases have increased over the years in Haryana with the x axis showing the year and the y axis showing the number of leases. It shows that the numbr of leased lands are only increasing.

2) Line plot(Generated for the 1st dataset) - It shows 2 lines. One line shows how the number of leases have varied over the years in Haryana and the other line shows what was the corresponding areas covered by the leased land in the respective years.
It shows that the area covered by the leased land doesnot follow any partiular pattern and keeps varying over the years.

3) Box plot(Generated for the 2nd dataset) - It shows 2 boxplots. One for the population at various places in Uttar Pradesh for the year 2001 and other for the population in the same places but for the year 2011. as can be observed from the plots, the outliers have increased in the year 2011 as the population has increased so much. The overall median also has gone up.
